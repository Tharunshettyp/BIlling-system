# Python Billing-System Using Tkinter

# Overview
I developed a desktop-based Billing System using Python and Tkinter that provides a simple and interactive graphical user interface for generating customer bills. The application allows users to select products, enter quantities, and automatically calculates the total bill amount. It reduces manual calculation errors and speeds up the billing process through automation. The system is designed to be user-friendly and suitable for small shops or learning purposes. This project demonstrates my understanding of Python GUI development, event handling, and basic business logic implementation. It also serves as a foundation for future enhancements like database integration and report generation.

# Features
* User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for easy navigation and billing operations.
* Product selection and quantity input with automatic price calculation.
* Real-time bill generation showing item-wise and total amount.
* Error reduction by automating manual billing and calculations.
* Extensible design, allowing future upgrades like database storage, GST calculation, or invoice printing.

# Code Structure 
* GUI Setup:
  Uses Tkinter to create the user interface, including an entry for input and buttons for numbers and operations.
* Functions:
   1.Accepts user input for products and quantities through the GUI.
   2.Calculates total bill amount automatically based on selected items.
   3.Displays the generated bill/receipt in an organized format.
   4.Handles reset/clear operations to create a new bill for the next customer.
* Example : 
  A shopkeeper opens the billing system and selects items like Rice and Oil. He enters the quantities (2 kg Rice, 1 Oil packet). The system automatically calculates the total price and displays the final bill on     the screen. After completing the transaction, the shopkeeper clears the data and starts a new bill for the next customer.
